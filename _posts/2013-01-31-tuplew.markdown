title: Scalaz's TupleW
tested_by: "scalaz/TupleWSpec"
---
* Hmm, no source file but there is documentation for [scalaz.TupleW](http://scalaz.github.com/scalaz/scalaz-2.9.1-6.0.4/doc.sxr/scalaz/TupleW.scala.html);
* `fold` does what I'd like for tuple to do: convert itself into the parameters for a function;
* `mapElements` allows for mapping of elements independently, but could be cumbersome for large tuples;
* `toIndexedSeq` gives you an indexed sequence, although [shapeless]() might offer a better one with an `HList`.
